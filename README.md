# Zomato-Project
Zomato, a leading multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company, seeks to understand the factors
that contribute to restaurant popularity and revenue generation. Upon analyzing the data, we found that traditional 
metrics such as ratings and cuisine pricing do not significantly influence either popularity or profitability.
Instead, the type of cuisine offered emerges as a critical determinant of a restaurant's success. Our findings indicate 
that establishments specializing in North Indian, Chinese, and South Indian cuisine tend to outperform their peers in
terms of customer appeal and financial performance. In light of these insights, Zomato has the opportunity to enhance
its offerings by introducing a new menu that aligns with consumer preferences. Additionally, by identifying and 
potentially phasing out less popular cuisines, the company can mitigate annual profit losses and better allocate
resources to maximize overall profitability.
